# When
This action is to be used with a workflow run for a pull request event or push event with the pull number in the
commit message ( matches on #*pullnumber*)
The action can also be used with a repository dispatch of a pull request or push workflow run [see](https://github.com/tonyhallett/workflow-run-conclusion-dispatch-action).  In this case you need to set the input workflowPayload.

# Behaviour
Will create comment/s in pull request and / or associated issues containing the url to artifacts from the workflow run being watched.

# Inputs
## pull request event only
pullState is used to restrict the pull requests returned and defaults to open.  Change to all or closed as necessary

## Error behaviour

The default behaviour is to fail when there are no artifacts - control this with errorNoArtifacts.

There will be an error if there is no pull request found.
Set continue-on-error: true in your workflow if the error is to be ignored.
## Comment control

Comments can be created in the pull request and / or associated issues - control with addTo.

The comment that is generated can have a prefix and a suffix.

It is possible to filter out artifacts from comments by using the artifact name.

This is a accomplished with either includes or includesFormatted.  The latter being used if the formatting of the 
artifacts is not consistent.

If includes is not provided then all artifacts are included.  
If you provide then e.g - name1, name2

If using includesFormatted then - array of objects {name:string,format?:string}

### Formatting

There are 3 formats

The default, url, will just have the url of the artifact in the comment. 

Name will result in `[name](url)`

The final format is custom and is a format string e.g `Whatever [{name}]({url}) etc`


## Related issues

The remaining inputs control the discovery of the pull request associated issues.

There are 4 ways that associated issues can be specified.
### Common

All 4 use the inputs closeWords and caseSensitive as part of their matching.  

Close words defaults to the close words used by github to automatically close an issue from a pull request.
### Pull request and commits

In the pull request itself - control with usePullTitle and usePullBody.

In the pull request commits - control with useCommitMessages.

The pull request title, pull request body and commit messages will match against *closeWord* #123

### Branch name

Control with useBranch, branchIssueWords and branchDelimiters.


The branch name will match *closeWord* *delimiter* *branchIssueWord* *delimiter* *issuenumber* e.g - fix-issue-123
